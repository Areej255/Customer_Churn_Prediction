# Customer_Churn_Prediction
End-to-end customer churn prediction using machine learning with a Streamlit dashboard, focusing on high-recall modeling and business-driven decision metrics.


Customer Churn Prediction & Retention Analysis

📌 Project Overview

Customer churn directly impacts business revenue. This project focuses on predicting customers who are likely to churn using machine learning, with a strong emphasis on high recall to minimize missed churners. A Streamlit dashboard is built to make predictions interpretable and actionable from a business perspective.
This is an end-to-end project covering data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

🎯 Business Objective

Identify customers at high risk of churn
Prioritize recall over accuracy to avoid missing churners
Support retention campaigns while considering campaign and retention costs
Enable non-technical users to interact with model outputs via a dashboard
